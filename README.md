# AI Programming with Python Nanodegree from Udacity
This repository contains the files that I created for the AI Programming with Python Nanodegree final project. For more information on the project, see the link here:

## Nanodegree Breakdown
This nanodegree consisted of five different sections.
1. **An Introduction to Python** where we start coding with Python, drawing upon libraries and automation scripts to solve complex problems quickly;
2. **Jupyter Notebooks, NumPy, Anaconda, pandas, and Matplotlib** where we learned how to use all the key tools for working with data in Python: Jupyter Notebooks, NumPy, Anaconda, pandas, and Matplotlib;
3. **Linear Algebra Essentials** where we learned the foundational linear algebra you need for AI success: vectors, linear transformations, and matricesâ€”as well as the linear algebra behind neural networks;
4. **Calculus Essentials** where we learned the foundations of calculus to understand how to train a neural network: plotting, derivatives, the chain rule, and more. See how these mathematical skills visually come to life with a neural network example;
5. And finally **Neural Networks** where we gained a solid foundation in the hottest fields in AI: neural networks, deep learning, and PyTorch.

## Projects in the nanodegree
The nanodegree consists of two projects:
1. Training a neural network with a pretrained image classifier;
2. Creating a neural network from scratch with transfer learning.

For the first project we were tasked with utilizing what we had learned through the first module to create a neural network that could identify dog breeds.
Mostly geared towards brushing up on Python programming skills, this project taught us the beginnings of creating a neural network.

For the second project I utilized all of the skills that I learned in the program to create a neural network from scratch that could identify flower species.
The code for both projects can be found in this repository.

## Completion and Certification Date
I successfully completed this project and was awarded a certificate of completion on July 1st, 2020.
